## Artist's Statement

This project was based on the idea of equality vs equality.
If the game was too easy for you, it means you were privileged.

Someone has to work harder to get the same result.
Even though, we believe it is all the same rights and same opportunities.
Some start this game with big disadvantages or penalties with them.

Michael Sandel asks the same thing from the book, The Tyranny of Merit; What's Become of the Common Good?

Is the society we live in really fair?
Is it really fair to discriminate based on individual abilities?
Does our life depend only on ability?
Elements unrelated to abilities really don't work at all.

No one can be confident that I have accomplished everything in my life entirely with my own strength and my own abilities.
We all know well that even my birth is not my ability.

Discrimination that we believe to be justified exists in our hearts, which have long been stained with the brazen lies of meritocracy for a long time.
No one would be unaware that those who rose to a certain position or position in society worked hard and lived their lives as hard as they did.
However, if all results are judged only by "effort", people who do not have a certain level of achievement, academic ability, or intellectual level are likely to be evaluated as 'lazy'.

If people who work harder than anyone else and try their best than anyone else get frustrated, what they need is not "effort".
We need to step back and look at the land we live in.
In order to survive in this unfair land, it is not easy to realize the discriminatory mind that has rationalized itself in the ranks that have been tamed unknowingly.

The world will be even worse if we don't find a serious contradiction in the phrase "differential treatment based on ability." In the first place, perfect meritocracy cannot be realized. In addition, complete meritocracy further solidifies discrimination based on strict class and rank. If you do not discover the loopholes and contradictions of meritocracy, you will be deceived by "fair discrimination".

Those who know a little more should help those who know less. If knowing a little more makes you more inhuman and makes you discriminate against someone, then that knowledge should be thrown away. A society that does not discriminate against anyone for any reason and respects people as people is mutually beneficial.

We ourselves, our consciousness, our words, and our actions, must become the social safety net itself. Only then can you, yourself, your loved ones, and your precious friends be saved from a quick death.

"**The meritocratic ideal is not a remedy for inequality; it is a justification of inequality.**" - Michael J. Sandel
